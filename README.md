# Chunithm Lasercut and 3D printed assembly to hold your arcade slider and air sensors

This is a lasercutted and 3D printed case for a standalone arcade slider and air side devices.

## Notes
- Requires a lasercutter with a bed size of at least 800x200 mm
- Requires a 3D Printer
- Around the same size as a real panel.
- The current design does not have any mounting holes for the slider (sorry)
  so you will need to mark and drill your own mounting holes.
- You can use any material as long as it's strong enough and has the correct thickness.
- You can also stack different thicknesses of materials to make it thick enough.
- For wiring the slider and the airs, go to the [wiki](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Chunithm).

## Thanks
Thanks to Moldypie and mon for their arcade slider cases and the air sensor mounting dimensions.
